First, make sure you've completed [step 1](/developer-docs/latest/getting-started/quick-start-step1) to create a project with Strapi.

If you wanted quick results and have just created a Gatsby blog with our starter CLI, keep on with the **Starters** path to get to know how to edit content for your blog ‚úçÔ∏è.

If you felt more adventurous and have just created a blank app, go for the **Hands-on** path and we will guide you through creating a restaurants directory, based on our [FoodAdvisor](https://github.com/strapi/foodadvisor) example app ‚Äçü•ò.

## üé® Step 2: Play with your content

Strapi [starters](https://strapi.io/starters) build a full stack app and a data structure for you, so you can start playing with your content faster. You already have the admin panel for your blog running at [http://localhost:1337/admin](http://localhost:1337/admin). Now what?

:::tip TIP
If the server is not already running, in your terminal, `cd` into the `my-project` folder and run `yarn develop` (or `npm run develop`) to launch it.

### 1. Add yourself as a writer

You have several ideas for great articles in mind. But first, the world needs to know who you are!

Navigate to [_COLLECTION TYPES > Writers_](http://localhost:1337/admin/plugins/content-manager/collectionType/application::writer.writer?page=1&pageSize=10&_sort=name:ASC) in the left-hand menu, and click the **+ Add New Writers** button.

![Screenshot: Create a new writer in Admin Panel](../assets/quick-start-guide/qsg-starters-step2-01-writer.png)

First, add your **Name** and **Email** in the corresponding fields. 

Then, drag and drop your favorite selfie in the **Picture** field. Click **Upload 1 asset to the library** then **Finish** (saying 'Cheese!' during the process is optional üòÑ).

Finally, click **Save**.

> ü•≥  _Voil√†_! You have just added yourself as a writer.

### 2. Write & publish your first article

Now it's time to write!  Navigate to [_COLLECTION TYPES > Articles_](http://localhost:1337/admin/plugins/content-manager/collectionType/application::article.article?page=1&pageSize=10&_sort=title:ASC) in the left-hand menu, and click the **+ Add New Articles** button.

![Screenshot: Create a new article in Admin Panel](../assets/quick-start-guide/qsg-starters-step2-02-write_article.png)

Type `Hello World!` in the **Title** field, then `My very first article with Strapi` in the **Description** field, and write a few lines in the **Content** field. If you're lacking some inspiration, just type `This is my first blog article with Strapi and using it feels like a breeze!`.

Once done, in the right sidebar, choose your name in the **Author** dropdown.  You have just signed your first article with Strapi. Take a few seconds to contemplate this historic moment! While in the right sidebar, 
you might also want to choose a **Category** for your post (or add your own) from the list.

Scroll down, pick a date in the **PublishedAt** field, then add a picture in the **Image** field, either by drag & drop, or by selecting a file from the Strapi assets library or from your computer.

By default, your new article would be saved as a draft. But let's not be too shy, and publish it right away: from the **Status** dropdown, choose **published**.

Finally, click on **Save** at the top of the window.

> ü•≥  You have just created and published your very first article with Strapi.

### 3. Update the Homepage

It's time to make this blog a bit more yours. Navigate to [_SINGLE TYPES > Homepage_](http://localhost:1337/admin/plugins/content-manager/singleType/application::homepage.homepage) in the left-hand menu.

Hover the picture in the **ShareImage field** and click the **Edit** icon <Fa-PencilAlt />. Click on **Replace Media** and upload an image from your computer. This image will represent your blog when sharing an article on social medias. Click **Finish** twice.

Now, update the **Title** to `My Wonderful Strapi Blog` in the **Hero** field group, then click **Save**.

Gatsby is a static-site generator. It means that you need to restart the server for changes to appear on the frontend. In your terminal, press `Ctrl-C` to kill the servers. Then restart them by typing `yarn develop` (or `npm run develop`) and press `Enter`.

After a few moments, you should see your blog with its updated title running at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). The `Hello World!` article you have just created is also visible at the bottom of the page üëÄ
