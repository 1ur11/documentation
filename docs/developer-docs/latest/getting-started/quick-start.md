Strapi offers a lot of flexibility. Whether you want to go fast and quickly see the final result, or would rather dive deeper into the product, we got you covered.

First, make sure [Node.js and npm are properly installed](/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/installation/cli.md#step-1-make-sure-requirements-are-met) on your machine. Optionally, you can also [install the Yarn package here](https://yarnpkg.com/en/).

Then, using the buttons below, please choose between:

- the **Starters** path for the quickest way to spin up a fullstack application (blog, e-commerce solution, corporate website, portfolioâ€¦) powered by a Strapi backend,
- or the **Hands-on** path for a more DIY approach to run your project.

## ðŸš€ Step 1: Create a new project with Strapi Starters

To create a Gatsby blog using Strapi, run one of the following commands in a terminal:

<code-group>
<code-block title="NPX">

```bash
npx create-strapi-starter my-project gatsby-blog
```

</code-block>
<code-block title="YARN">

```bash
yarn create strapi-starter my-project gatsby-blog
```

</code-block>
</code-group>

When terminal asks "Choose your installation type", press Enter to select the default "Quickstart (recommended)" option. After a few moments, your web browser opens 2 tabs.

The first tab ([http://localhost:1337/admin/auth/register-admin](http://localhost:1337/admin/auth/register-admin)) is for the backend of your app. Complete the form to create the first Administrator user:

The second tab ([http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)) is for the frontend of your app, and you can already see the Gatsby blog in action:
